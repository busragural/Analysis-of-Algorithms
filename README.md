# Analysis-of-Algorithms

This repo contains the solutions and analyses of the problems specified in the Algorithm Analysis course.

In file 1, there is a solution and analysis of the nuts and bolts problem with the quick sort algorithm.
In file 2, there is a project and analysis of insertion and deletion operations in hash table using Horner's Rule. Double hashing method is used in case of collusion during insertion. 
In file 3, there is a code and analysis of the longest common subsequence of two words using a dynamic programming approach.
In file 4, the BFS algorithm is used to calculate the intercept value for community detection and the algorithm is finalised according to the values of k and t.
